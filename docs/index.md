# AromaTools (version 1.0)

**AromaTools** is a computational toolkit designed to facilitate the analysis of aromaticity using complementary geometric and magnetic criteria.

The software integrates widely used descriptors into a unified and user-friendly workflow, allowing researchers to evaluate aromatic behavior in molecular systems in a reproducible and systematic manner.

Aromaticity is not a directly observable physical property, but rather a conceptual framework inferred from different manifestations of electron delocalization. Because no single descriptor fully captures this phenomenon, reliable analysis typically requires the combined use of multiple criteria. AromaTools aims to simplify this process by providing automated workflows for the calculation and analysis of aromaticity indices derived from molecular structure and magnetic response.

## Main features

### Unified aromaticity analysis
AromaTools integrates multiple descriptors commonly used to characterize aromaticity:

**Geometric criteria**  

- HOMA  
- HOMAc  
- HOMER  
- BLA (Bond Length Alternation)

**Magnetic criteria**   

- NICS (SP, 2D, 3D)  
- NICS-scan  
- Integral NICS (INICS)  
- Induced magnetic field (Bind)  
- Ring current strength (Ampère–Maxwell approach)  
- Molecular orbital decomposition of the shielding tensor (Only with Gaussian)  
- Pseudo-π model implementation for π-electron magnetic response analysis  
- Generation of scalar fields (.cube) and visualization grids (.vtk)  

These descriptors provide complementary perspectives on electron delocalization in cyclic systems.

Each module can be used independently for a more complete characterization of aromatic behavior.

### Automated workflows

The code is designed to minimize manual intervention and reduce sources of error:

- Automatic detection of molecular rings
- Automatic construction of spatial grids
- Automatic molecular orientation based on principal moments of inertia
- Automated preparation of quantum chemistry inputs
- Automatic post-processing of outputs
- Automatic generation of plots and tables in format .csv

This approach improves reproducibility and allows users to focus on chemical interpretation rather than technical setup.

## Design philosophy

AromaTools was developed with the following objectives:

- Provide a unified platform for aromaticity analysis
- Reduce fragmentation between different computational tools
- Facilitate reproducible workflows
- Minimize manual preparation of inputs
- Simplify post-processing of results
- Allow flexible integration with common quantum chemistry software

The software is particularly suited for studies involving:

- Aromatic and antiaromatic systems
- Heterocycles
- Excited-state aromaticity
- Magnetic response analysis
- Comparative aromaticity studies

## Future developments

AromaTools is under active development and several new features are currently being implemented in order to expand the scope of aromaticity analysis.

**AroGeometric**

Planned improvements for upcoming versions include:

- Detection of equivalent rings to reduce computational cost
- Multi-system HOMA index calculation

**AroMagnetic**

Planned improvements for upcoming versions include:

- Implementation of workflows compatible with **Turbomole**
- Calculation of **Bind** and **NICS** decomposed by molecular orbital (MO) with Orca
- Implementation of the **NICS2BC** methodology for visualization of current pathways derived from NICS data
- Improved exploitation of **molecular symmetry** in profile module and **NICS-scan**
- Reading files (.out, .log) in ORCA, Gaussian, and ASE-compatible formats

These developments aim to improve the interpretation of magnetic response descriptors and facilitate the connection between molecular electronic structure and aromatic behavior.

**AroElectrinics**

Work is also in progress to incorporate **electronic aromaticity criteria**, enabling a more comprehensive evaluation of electron delocalization.

The inclusion of electronic criteria will allow AromaTools to provide a unified framework combining:

- Geometric criteria
- Magnetic criteria
- Electronic criteria

This integration is expected to improve consistency between different aromaticity criteria and provide deeper insight into the nature of cyclic electron delocalization.

AromaTools continues evolving toward a unified platform for multidimensional aromaticity analysis.
